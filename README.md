[How to work Shellsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort)

This project show how to work a shell sort algorithm and how a sequence can impact in performance.

## Sequences implemented:
### Ciura (1, 4, 10, 23, 57, 132, 301, 701, 1577, 3548, 7983, 17961, 40412, 90927, 204585, 460316, 1035711)
### Knuth (1, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88573, 265720, 797161, 2391484)
### Shell (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576))

> You can create your own sequence and test its performance. 
Just create a class and extend the sequence. Then implement in main and add the sequence list
